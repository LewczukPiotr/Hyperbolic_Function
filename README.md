# Hyperbolic_Function
This code implements simulations and LMA to optimize hyperbolic function governing the blood-CSF proteins diffusion. This code accompanies the paper: Lewczuk P, Estimation of the Parameters of the Reiberâ€™s Hyperbolic Function with the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm, XXX, where more details on the subject can be found.
